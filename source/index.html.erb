<h2>Merry Christmas!</h2>
<p>I, your wonderful son/brother(-in-law)/husband/friend (ahem, Jackson), Douglas "Doug-e-fresh" Alan Metalhands Pilcher, the first of his name, am a huge fan of all the Pilcher family traditions. That includes, but is not limited to, the gleeful dissemination of our Christmas lists to the rest of the family. I thought it would be helpful to gather these lists in a central location for everyone's convenience throughout the holidays. I was also looking for a project to practice some skills I've been learning lately. So here you go, the Pilcher Family Christmas website is a thing.</p>
<p>If you've sent a list, you can find it in the dropdown list in the navigation menu, or (if you are on a screen larger than a phone) on the left of the page.</p>
