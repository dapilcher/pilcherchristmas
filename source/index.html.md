## Merry Christmas!

I, your wonderful son/brother(-in-law)/husband/friend (ahem, Jackson), Douglas "Doug-e-fresh" Alan Metalhands Pilcher, the first of his name, am a huge fan of all the Pilcher family traditions. That includes, but is not limited to, the gleeful dissemination of our Christmas lists to the rest of the family. I thought it would be helpful to gather these lists in a central location for everyone's convenience throughout the holidays. I was also looking for a project to practice some skills I've been learning lately. So here you go, the Pilcher Family Christmas website is a thing.

<p class="d-md-block d-none">If you've sent your list you can find a link to the left or in the dropdown list in the navigation menu.</p>

###### P.S.

I figured this could evolve from just Christmas lists into a general repository of holiday plans & itineraries throughout the year. I am open to feedback.
