In the order of most want

1. You volunteer three hours of your time to help us paint trim in our house next May to ready it for the market. If this is too much of an ask....
1. Mittens
1. Socks
1. You could all go in on a single gift of an experience with Craig and Jack (children's museum tickets, etc.)
1. A hoodie zipup sweater which I will love but am guaranteed to lose within four months bc I don't have a great track record.
1. Send $10 to a local school of your choice to help pay off the unpaid lunch accounts for a family. $10 can purchase about three hot lunches for a student.
