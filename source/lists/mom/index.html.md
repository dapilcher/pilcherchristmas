## Mom's List

---

As you are all well aware, I like to receive whatever you think I'd like!!  But if you need ideas, here's a couple (pretty much in order):

- Anything you have made yourself.
- I LOVE the picture with Santa that you all took a few years back.  But now, there's more people that need to be in it.  (I know, a tough one to do since we aren't all together much.)  Maybe even just a picture of all of you -- not necessarily with Santa.
- Bluetooth speaker to use in my sewing room.
- Earrings -- small silver balls.
- [Glencairn whiskey glasses][glencairn] (a set of 4).
- 3x5" recipe cards.  I like those from Current -- most of the ones I have in my recipe box are what are now called ["Vintage" recipe cards][vintage] from Current (or maybe [these][butterfly]).  But they also have [new ones][current] that are available.
- A nice (I like wooden) recipe card box for 3x5 cards (a bit harder to find than the 4x6" size) -- ebay has some.
- Gardening gloves with fingers/palms/finger tips coated with rubber.
- Sewing "snips", something like [these][snips].  I like the smaller, lighter ones.  (I already have a big bulky pair.)
